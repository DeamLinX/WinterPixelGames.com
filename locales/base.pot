"**GOOBER ROYALE** is a multiplayer battle royale game in which each player "
"controls a character (called a \"goober\") and must collect weapons, power-"
"ups and other items to eliminate their opponents. The clashes bring together "
"16 players on a map and the objective will be to be the last survivor of the "
"game. You can play alone or in a team of 4 players. Your Goober will have "
"several weapons, a main missile that reloads at regular intervals and a "
"secondary accessory such as mines, a tornado, a drill and many others. Also "
"use your jetpack to move around the map more easily, reach high places and "
"surprise your opponents. Completing games and missions will earn you gold "
"coins that you can spend either to improve your Goober's skills or to buy "
"cosmetics that will give your character a unique style. An online ranking "
"will allow you to see the 100 best players in the world and in your region."
